This repository contains some useful python scripts for our
project.

The pre-requisite libraries required to use those codes are:

    1. OpenCV
    2. Hickle (https://github.com/telegraphic/hickle)
    3. Scikit Learn
    4. PyCaffe (Plus its dependencies)- http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/

TODO: Have to come up with a successful 2-layer LSTM architecture for
our project.
